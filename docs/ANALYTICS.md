# Analytics

MakerWorks uses [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) to collect aggregated, anonymized usage statistics. This information helps us understand how the platform is used so we can improve features and performance without tracking individual users or setting cookies.

## Opt-out

Plausible honors the browser's **Do Not Track** setting. To manually opt out, open your browser's developer console and run:

```javascript
localStorage.plausible_ignore = "true";
```

Reload the page and no further analytics data will be sent from this browser. Remove the flag or clear your storage to re-enable analytics.
